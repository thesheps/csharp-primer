Visual Studio Code is a really terrific editor for the language, and gives great support for macros, extensions etc.  Do it :)

```csharp
using System;

namespace ConsoleApplication
{
    public class Program
    {
        public static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");
        }
    }
}
```
