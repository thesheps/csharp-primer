## Let's get going!

Visual Studio Code is a really terrific editor for the language, and gives great support for macros, extensions etc.  Do it :)


Once you're setup, you should have an example project that looks a little bit like:

```csharp
using System;

namespace ConsoleApplication
{
    public class Program
    {
        public static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");
        }
    }
}
```

Note how painfully similar to Java it is?  It's basically stolen.  I think the only differing line for an equivalent hello world console app is the 

```csharp
Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");
```

as opposed to a:

```java
System.Out.PrintLn("Hello World!");
```

in Java.


More to come...
